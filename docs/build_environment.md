|     Solution 1 : Build   out of AML an push in Azure Container Registry            |                Network security in AML         remains the tightest                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                Data scientist needs an         additional (local?) environment to build up their dependency list       You also need an out of         AML workflow to build the image (it may be a Devops pipeline)           |   |   |
|     Solution 2 : Open   network traffic from compute instances to the internet     |                Give data scientist full         access to internet resources       You may provide finer         access by tuning rules                                                                                                                                                      |                Data compromission is at         higher risk : you don't control data direction : data may flow from & to  a network resource (Github)                                                                          |   |   |
|     Solution 3 :   Leverage additional services to act as a DMZ                    |                You can provide a wide         range of dependencies to data scientist       Data scientist can build         their own dependencies list from it and optimize their environment for         inference       You retain a full control         of your company data           |                This requires         implementation & management of additional tools              Mirror Git          repository  (example : Gitlab)        Mirror Python/R package          (example : Nexus)                 |   |   |
